# Laboratory 5

Design and implement a JavaFX java.UI for the application you have been working on for your home assignment. The classes in layers except the java.UI should not be modified. The GUI should allow all operations that your console java.UI provided (basically, your application should offer functionalities for all requirements in your previous assignments). 


**Bonus (0.4p)** \
Add a multiple undo/redo functionality for your application. Implement this functionality using **inheritance and polymorphism**, as illustrated in the attached figure. The performed operations (actions) can be memorized in undo/redo stacks.
